# 2nd internship project

<p>
  This project is meant to make a person life, who works with data, a bit easier, by visualizing the data for him. The original data was about some cells, to predict which ones were infected or not, but due to     confidentiality reasons, I had to share some other data, which were data you can find anywhere. 
</p>

<p>
  It is easy to run this one. Just install the packages in the requirements and run it with the command <br/> streamlit run &lt your_main_file_name &gt.py
</p>
<p>
  In this case, the main one is home.py. There are different data in the data folder, which are also saved in the database. You can modify the code to make it work with the other data as well.
