# 2nd internship project

<p style="color:red;">
  This project is meant to make a person's life, who works with data, a bit easier, by visualising the data for him. The original data was about some cells, to predict which one were infected or not, but due to     confidentiality reasons, I had to share some other data, which were data you can find anywhere.
